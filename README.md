This repository contains a simple Streamlit application for analyzing Solana wallet transactions using the Helius API. It fetches on-chain transaction data for any Solana wallet address, categorizes each transaction (buy, sell, or transfer), calculates a basic profit & loss (PnL) using mock prices, and displays all results in a user-friendly, interactive dashboard with filtering options.
